# 5-Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

This assignment application implements newly instructed upon code from 3rd party APIs jQuery and Day.js in addition to previously learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user will be able to add to-do tasks into a standard work day schedule and save them for planning purposes. This application helped teach me how to implement jQuery and Day.js as supplements to JavaScript.
